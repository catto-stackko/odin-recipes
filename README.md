This is my first Odin project. 

Here is an outline of everything I've done to complete it. 
1. Created a new public repository on GitHub for the new project
2. Used git clone git@github.com:catto-stackko/odin-recipes.git to add the remote repo to my local machine
3. Used cd to move into the correct project directory
4. Set up this README with touch README.md

5. Created index.html with touch
6. Added the typical html boiler plate
7. Added the title: "Odin Recipes"

8. Used mkdir to create a new directory within odin-recipes called recipes, this is where recipe pages will be contained
9. Created a lucky-lunch.html which 
10. Added a boilerplate and header to lucky-lunch.html
11. Returned to index.html to add a link to the new recipe page
    a. <a>Lucky Lunch</a> creates a button with "Lucky Lunch" as the title
    b. <a href="recipes/lucky-lunch.html">Lucky Lunch</a> adds the local link to the button to make it actually work
12. Used git commit -m "descriptive message" to commit the file changes

Third Iteration:
13. Added an image of lucky lunch in game to the page with <img src="../images/lucky-lunch-in-game.jpg" alt="lucky lunch in game"> the two period indicate the parent directory as that directory holds the images folder where all images are held.
14. Added an "Ingredients" section with an unordered list (<ul> with <li> enclosed)
15. Added a "Steps" section with an ordered/numbered list (<ol> with <li> enclosed)
16. Added bold with <strong>
17. Saved progress with git
