This is my first Odin project. 

Here is an outline of everything I've done to complete it. 
1. Created a new public repository on GitHub for the new project
2. Used git clone git@github.com:catto-stackko/odin-recipes.git to add the remote repo to my local machine
3. Used cd to move into the correct project directory
4. Set up this README with touch README.md

First Iteration:
5. Created index.html with touch
6. Added the typical html boiler plate
7. Added the title: "Odin Recipes"

Second Iteration:
8. Used mkdir to create a new directory within odin-recipes called recipes, this is where recipe pages will be contained
9. Created a lucky-lunch.html which 
10. Added a boilerplate and header to lucky-lunch.html
11. Returned to index.html to add a link to the new recipe page
    a. <a>Lucky Lunch</a> creates a button with "Lucky Lunch" as the title
    b. <a href="recipes/lucky-lunch.html">Lucky Lunch</a> adds the local link to the button to make it actually work
12. Used git commit -m "descriptive message" to commit the file changes
