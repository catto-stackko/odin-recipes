This is my first Odin project. 

Here is an outline of everything I've done to complete it. 
1. Created a new public repository on GitHub for the new project
2. Used git clone git@github.com:catto-stackko/odin-recipes.git to add the remote repo to my local machine
3. Used cd to move into the correct project directory
4. Set up this README with touch README.md

First Iteration:
5. Created index.html with touch
6. Added the typical html boiler plate
7. Added the title: "Odin Recipes"
